# Pantheon

These instructions show how to configure Tugboat for a typical site hosted on
Pantheon. While these instructions are for a Drupal 8 site, the concepts should
apply for any PHP site hosted by Pantheon. Check out the
[Drupal 7](../drupal7/index.md) and [WordPress](../wordpress/index.md) tutorials
for comparisons.

> #### Warning::Git Provider
>
> These instructions you have already configured an external git repository
> provider such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Pantheon has documentation on
> [how to use GitHub](https://pantheon.io/docs/guides/build-tools/).
