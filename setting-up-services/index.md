# Setting up Services in your Tugboat

First thing's first:
[in the context of Tugboat, what are Services, exactly?](#what-are-tugboat-services)

Once you understand that, take a look at:

**How to set up Services in Tugboat:**

1. [Name your Service](#name-your-service)
2. [Specify a Service image](#specify-a-service-image)
3. [Define a default Service](#define-a-default-service)
4. [Expose a Service HTTP Port](#expose-a-service-http-port)
5. [Set the Document Root Path](#set-the-document-root-path)

**Services options and reference**

- [Service Commands](#service-commands)
- [Running a Background Process](#running-a-background-process)

Want to see an example of what Services might look like for your site? Take a
look at: [Services in action](#services-in-action).

## What are Tugboat Services?

A Tugboat Service plays the role of what a server might provide in a production
environment. A service can be a web server, a database server, a cache store,
etc. Services form the core of your
[Config file](../setting-up-tugboat/index.md#create-a-tugboat-config-file),
working together to build a [Preview](../building-a-preview/index.md).

Under the cover, Tugboat Services are Docker images. This tech gives you some
powerful functionality in building your services - i.e. specifying a specific
PHP version when serving Drupal sites, or using an image to mirror your
production services. For more info, check out:
[Specify a Service image](#specify-a-service-image).

For an example of what Services might look like in your site, check out:
[Services in action](#services-in-action).

## How to set up Services in Tugboat

1. [Name your Service](#name-your-service)
2. [Specify a Service image](#specify-a-service-image)
3. [Define a default Service](#define-a-default-service)
4. [Expose a Service HTTP Port](#expose-a-service-http-port)
5. [Set the Document Root Path](#set-the-document-root-path)

### Name your Service

The top level of your
[Config file](../setting-up-tugboat/index.md#create-a-tugboat-config-file) is a
`services` key whose value is a list of Services.

```yaml
services:
  service1:
  service2:
  service3:
```

Service names are arbitrary, but they act as the internal host name for the
Service. This is the name other Services in the Preview would use to refer to
the Service. As a result, there are a few rules you must observe when naming
Services:

- Service names may only include the characters `a-z`, `0-9`, and `-`.
- Service names are limited to 39 characters.

As an example, a set of Services that serve a PHP-based site with a MySQL
database and a Redis cache might be:

```yaml
services:
  apache:
  mysql:
  redis:
```

After you name the Service, you'll need to
[specify a Service image](#specify-a-service-image).

### Specify a Service image

Because Tugboat uses Docker under the hood, every Service in your config file
must use a
[valid Docker image address](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/).

Here's what you need to know about working with Service images in Tugboat:

> #### Info::New to Docker images?
>
> Tugboat has abstracted away some of the technical aspects of working with
> Docker images, but if you're new to Docker, and want to understand more about
> Docker images,
> [check out Docker's documentation](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/userguide/storagedriver/imagesandcontainers/).

#### How to call a Service image from Docker Hub

Tugboat's default image registry is [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). When
you use an `image` key in the Service definition, Tugboat pulls the
corresponding image from Docker Hub.

- If you want to call a service image from another registry, see:
  [Bring your own Docker image from another registry](#bring-your-own-docker-image-from-another-registry).
- If you need to authenticate with Docker Hub to access an image contained in a
  private Docker repository, see:
  [Repository Settings -> Authenticate with a Docker Registry](../setting-up-tugboat/index.md#authenticate-with-a-docker-registry).

To call a Service image from Docker Hub, specify an `image` key in the Service
definition.

For example:

```yaml
services:
  apache:
    image: tugboatqa/httpd:2.4
  msyql:
    image: tugboatqa/mysql:5.6
```

To dissect the key value in our Apache image key example above, we're calling:

`tugboatqa` : Profile of the image provider on Docker Hub; in this case, it's
[TugboatQA](https://hub.docker.com/u/tugboatqa), the organization.  
`httpd` : This is the specific image we're calling; in this case, it's Tugboat's
version of the [Apache HTTP Server](https://hub.docker.com/r/tugboatqa/httpd).  
`2.4` : **OPTIONAL** version tag; in this case, we're calling for the specific
2.4 version of Tugboat's Apache HTTP server image. If you browse to Docker Hub's
[Tags page](https://hub.docker.com/r/tugboatqa/httpd/tags) for this image, you
can see a list of all the version tags available for Tugboat's Apache HTTP
Server image.

##### Image version tags

Use tags to indicate specific versions of an image, if needed. In
[our example above](#how-to-call-a-service-image-from-docker-hub), you'll note
versions `2.4` or `5.6` for the `httpd` and `mysql` images.

You can specify version tags in a few different ways:

- [Point-release version tags](#point-release-version-tags)
- [Major version tags](#major-version-tags)
- [Latest version tags](#latest-version-tags)

> #### Note:: You don't have to specify a version tag
>
> If you don't need a specific version of a Service image, you can leave the tag
> off the image call. When you don't specify a tag, you'll get the latest
> version of that image.

If you're not sure which version tag to use, you can always browse to the
service image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and check out what tags
are available.

![Browse image tags on Docker Hub](_images/browse_tags_on_docker_hub.png)

###### Point-release version tags:

Using specific version tags helps prevent breaking changes that come along with
incremental updates. In our example above, we've called `tugboatqa/mysql:5.6`
instead of `tugboatqa/mysql:5`.

###### Major version tags

If you want to make sure you're using a specific major version, but don't care
about point releases, specify something like `tugboatqa/node:8` to ensure you
always use the latest available minor release of node 8.x.

###### Latest version tags

In some cases, you're less likely to be worried about a specific version; for
example, it may not matter which version of memcached you use.

When you don't need to call for a specific version of a Service, using just the
image name without a tag (`tugboatqa/memcached`), or the `latest` tag
(`tugboatqa/memcached:latest`) will get you the most recent version of a Service
image.

#### Tugboat's prebuilt Docker images

Tugboat maintains several
[prebuilt Docker images](../reference/services/index.md). These images are
extensions of
[official Docker images](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_repos/)
that include tools and configurations that help them work well with Tugboat.

For a complete list of Tugboat's images and tags, find us on
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/tugboatqa/).

You can check out the scripts we used to create these images on
[GitHub](https://github.com/TugboatQA/images).

#### Third-party Docker images

Theoretically, you can use any publicly available Docker image in your Tugboat
build. However, you may run into a limitation that can make third-party Docker
images problematic: Tugboat will not create a Service from an image that defines
any VOLUMES. For that reason, we recommend sticking with the images built
specifically for use with Tugboat.

If you'd like to use your own Docker images, this repo contains the scripts we
use to make an image Tugboat compatible: <https://github.com/TugboatQA/images>

> #### Info:: Why are Docker volumes not supported on Tugboat?
>
> Under the hood, Tugboat commits the entire state of the container (including
> files, databases, etc) to optimize Preview builds. This means that when
> building from a Base Preview, all the new Preview needs to do is run the
> `build` steps without importing a database or other required assets. (For more
> info, take a look at:
> [the build process: explained.](../building-a-preview/index.md#the-build-process-explained))
>
> Because of this, the concept of Docker volumes doesnâ€™t really mesh with the
> way Tugboat uses images.

#### Bring your own Docker Image from another registry

If you want to use a Docker image from another registry, it's easy to do; you
just have to specify the alternate registry, since Tugboat pulls from Docker Hub
by default.

For a full breakdown of how to pull from a different registry, check out
Docker's Docs:
[Pull from a different registry](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/#pull-from-a-different-registry).

_EXAMPLE PLACEHOLDER - BEN, PLEASE PROVIDE EXAMPLE_

An example of this in action at Tugboat might look like:

`$ docker pull myregistry.local:5000/testing/test-image`

#### Using a Docker image to mirror your production services

Using a Docker image to mirror your production services in Tugboat works the
same as pulling an image for any other Service in Tugboat. Simply follow the
[steps to set up Services in Tugboat](#setting-up-services-in-your-tugboat), and
specify your production image.

As you'll probably be pulling from a private repository, you may need to first:

1. [Authenticate with a Docker Registry](../setting-up-tugboat/index.md#authenticate-with-a-docker-registry)
   from Tugboat's
   [Repository Settings](../setting-up-tugboat/index.md#repository-settings-optional);
2. Take a look at
   [using third-party Docker images with Tugboat](#third-party-docker-images)
   for info about caveats, as well as links to scripts you could use to optimize
   your own image for Tugboat;
3. If you're pulling from a private Docker repository that isn't on Docker Hub,
   you'll need to follow the process in:
   [Bring your own Docker image from another registry](#bring-your-own-docker-image-from-another-registry).

> #### Note:: The same caveats apply regarding VOLUMES
>
> When using a Docker image to mirror your production services, keep in mind
> that Docker volumes aren't supported on Tugboat.

#### When does an image get pulled or updated?

Familiar with Docker, and looking for more specific information about when
images get pulled or updated in Tugboat? Here's what you need to know about
`docker pull` under the hood:

- [When does Tugboat pull a Docker image?](#when-does-tugboat-pull-a-docker-image)
- [When does Tugboat update a Docker image?](#when-does-tugboat-update-a-docker-image)

##### When does Tugboat pull a Docker image?

Tugboat doesn't pull the images in your config file every time you open a pull
request, or refresh a Preview; it only does a `docker pull` (under the hood)
when:

- You [build a Preview](../building-a-preview/index.md#how-to-build-a-preview)
  from scratch (without using a Base Preview)
- You [Rebuild](../building-a-preview/index.md#rebuild) a
  [Base Preview](../building-a-preview/index.md#set-a-base-preview)
- You
  [manually Rebuild a Preview that was built from a Base Preview - without using the Base Preview](../building-a-preview/index.md#building-a-preview-from-scratch-after-youve-set-a-base-preview)

Otherwise, Tugboat relies on the images you pulled when the Preview was first
created; [Preview Actions](../building-a-preview/index.md#preview-actions) like
[Refreshing a Preview](../building-a-preview/index.md#refresh),
[Cloning a Preview](../building-a-preview/index.md#clone), or
[automatically generating a Preview from a pull request](../building-a-preview/index.md#auto-generate-previews)
when you're using a
[Base Preview](../building-a-preview/index.md#set-a-base-preview) - those things
all keep the Docker images you referenced when you first built the Preview.

##### When does Tugboat update a Docker image?

Because Tugboat pulls your Docker images at the beginning of the Preview build
process, it won't `docker pull` an updated image unless you kick off the Preview
build process from scratch again.

For more info, see:
[Preview Actions that start at `init`](../building-a-preview/index.md#preview-actions-that-start-at-init).

> #### Hint:: Tugboat Preview isn't pulling your latest image tag?
>
> If your Tugboat Preview isn't pulling your latest Docker image tag, it might
> be because you're building from a Base Preview. If that's the case, you'll
> need to [Rebuild your Base Preview](../building-a-preview/index.md#rebuild),
> which executes an API call to `docker pull` under the hood to grab the image
> tag referenced in your
> [config file](../setting-up-tugboat/index.md#create-a-tugboat-config-file).
>
> If that still doesn't get you the image you expect, check your
> [config file](../setting-up-tugboat/index.md#create-a-tugboat-config-file) to
> see which [image tag](#image-version-tags) you're pulling; you may need to
> change the reference to latest, or a specific image tag, to get the result you
> want.

### Define a default Service

Every [Config file](../setting-up-tugboat/index.md#create-a-tugboat-config-file)
requires a default Service. The default Service is where HTTP requests are
routed when a [Preview's URL](../building-a-preview/index.md#share-your-preview)
is visited by a user.

If your Config file only has one Service, that Service automatically becomes the
default Service.

If your Config file contains multiple Services, you must designate one of them
as the `default`. Specify a default Service by adding a `default` key to the
Service, with a value of `true`.

```yaml
services:
  apache:
    image: tugboatqa/httpd:2.4
    default: true
  mysql:
    image: tugboatqa/mysql:5.6
```

> #### Note:: Default Service behaviors
>
> Setting a Service as the `default` - including when the Service is
> automatically designated `default` because it's the only Service - also
> implies that port 80 is exposed to the Tugboat Proxy, and that the git
> repository is cloned to /var/lib/tugboat.
>
> To override the Service HTTP port, see:
> [Expose a Service HTTP port](#expose-a-service-http-port)  
> To override the git repository clone destination, see:
> [Cloning Git repositories into your Services](#cloning-git-repositories-into-your-services)

### Expose a Service HTTP port

Every Service in a Preview gets a unique URL. That URL is accessible if:

- An HTTP service is running on the Service, AND;
- The port is exposed to the Tugboat Proxy.

To expose a port, include an `expose` key in the Service definition with the
port number that the HTTP service is listening on.

```yaml
services:
  node:
    image: tugboatqa/node:8
    expose: 3000
```

In this example, the Tugboat Proxy forwards requests to the service's URL
through to a nodejs service running on port 3000.

There are other options that affect how the proxy routing is handled. These
advanced options can usually be left to their default settings. Look through the
[Tugboat Configuration File](../reference/tugboat-configuration/index.md)
reference for a complete list.

> #### Note:: Default Service port
>
> When a service is set as the `default`, port 80 is automatically exposed. You
> can override this by using the `expose` key to explicitly set an alternate
> port.

### Set the Document Root Path

Tugboat does not try to guess where your document root lives in your repository.
Likewise, it does not try to guess where a web server image expects to serve the
default document root from. This means you are responsible for making this link
in your
[configuration file](../setting-up-tugboat/index.md#create-a-tugboat-config-file)

Each web server image expects the document root to be in a different location.
This is a side effect of using the
[Official Docker Images](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_repos/).
The [images](#tugboats-prebuilt-docker-images) provided by Tugboat store this
document root location in an environment variable named `$DOCROOT` for
convenience.

Use this configuration to link the document root to a directory named `/docroot`
in your git repository. This works for the following images provided by Tugboat:
`tugboatqa/httpd`, `tugboatqa/nginx`, `tugboatqa/php:apache`

```yaml
services:
  apache:
    image: tugboatqa/httpd
    commands:
      init:
        - ln -snf "${TUGBOAT_ROOT}/web" "${DOCROOT}"
```

## Services options and reference

- [Cloning Git repositories into your Services](#cloning-git-repositories-into-your-services)
- [Service Commands](#service-commands)
- [Running a Background Process](#running-a-background-process)

### Cloning Git repositories into your Services

When Tugboat runs, it clones your git repository into
[your `default` Service](#define-a-default-service). Optionally, you can also
clone a copy of your git repository into other Services.

To explicitly request that a Service has access to the git repository, specify
the `checkout` key in the Service definition. This is especially useful if there
are Service-specific scripts or test data files committed to your git
repository.

```yaml
services:
  apache:
    image: tugboatqa/httpd:2.4
    default: true
  mysql:
    image: tugboatqa/mysql:5.6
    checkout: true
```

In this example, both the `apache` and `mysql` services get a clone of the git
repository, checked out to the git branch, tag, commit, or pull request that the
preview is created for. The path where the git repository is cloned is available
in an [environment variable](../reference/environment-variables/index.md) named
`$TUGBOAT_ROOT`

### Service Commands

While technically optional, Service Commands are arguably the most powerful part
of the
[configuration file](../setting-up-tugboat/index.md#create-a-tugboat-config-file).
This is the set of commands that Tugboat runs in a Service container while
creating a Preview.

The service commands are separated into a set of stages: `init`, `update`, and
`build`. Each stage represents an optional set of commands that Tugboat should
run during that stage. For more info on the stages in the Preview build process,
check out:
[the build process: explained](../building-a-preview/index.md#the-build-process-explained).

It may help to think of the stages as groups of commands with a particular
purpose. While not enforced in any way, the stages roughly represent the
following purposes:

- **init** - Run commands that set up the basic Preview infrastructure. This
  might include things like installing required packages or tools, or overriding
  default configuration files.

- **update** - Run commands that import data or other assets into a Service.
  This might include things like importing a database, or syncing image files
  into a service.

- **build** - Run commands that build or generate the actual site. This might
  include things like compiling Sass files, updating 3rd party libraries, or
  running database updates that the current code in the preview depends on.

> #### Info::Command Context
>
> Each command is run in its own context, meaning things like `cd` do not
> "stick" between commands. If that behavior is required, an external script
> should be included in the git repository and called from the config file.

```yaml
services:
  apache:
    image: tugboatqa/httpd:2.4
    default: true
    commands:
      init:
        - apt-get install nodejs
        - ln -snf "${TUGBOAT_ROOT}" "${DOCROOT}"
      update:
        - rsync -av example.com:files/ "${DOCROOT}/files/"
        - chgrp -R www-data "${DOCROOT}/files"
      build:
        - npm install
  mysql:
    image: tugboatqa/mysql:5.6
    commands:
      update:
        - scp example.com:mysqldump.sql.gz /tmp/
        - zcat /tmp/mysqldump.sql.gz | mysql tugboat
```

Notice that each stage is optional for a given service. There may not be any
commands required for that service during some stage. When that is the case, the
stage can be excluded completely.

### Running a Background Process

A long-running background process in Tugboat needs some special care. If you try
to add a background-process to your
[config file](../setting-up-tugboat/index.md#create-a-tugboat-config-file) in
the conventional way, Tugboat will think the Preview has not finished building,
and it will be stuck in the "building" state until it eventually times out and
fails.

> #### Info:: Services stop after the Preview builds
>
> The reason Tugboat needs to wait for all of the `build` commands to finish is
> that we stop the Services after a Preview build is finished in order to take a
> snapshot.

Our [prebuilt images](#tugboats-prebuilt-docker-images) use
[runit](http://smarden.org/runit/) to start and manage background processes.

To add your own background process that starts when the Service starts, create a
directory in `/etc/service/yourprocessname` and a script at
`/etc/service/yourprocessname/run` to tell `runit` how to start your process.

For example, the following `run` script would start Apache:

```
#!/bin/sh
exec httpd-foreground
```

Below is an example of how you might configure a NodeJS process to start. Keep
in mind that `runit` will try to start the process as soon as the `run` script
is present in the Service directory. So, set it up after any other build steps
that it might depend on.

```yaml
services:
  node:
    image: tugboatqa/node:8
      commands:
        init:
          - mkdir -p /etc/service/node
          - echo "#!/bin/sh" > /etc/service/node/run
          - echo "npm start --prefix ${TUGBOAT_ROOT}" >> /etc/service/node/run
          - chmod +x /etc/service/node/run
```

## Services in action

Now that we've gone through all the components you'll need to set up Services
for your Tugboat, let's take a look at an example
[config file](../setting-up-tugboat/index.md#create-a-tugboat-config-file) so
you can see Services in action. This config file is for a
[Drupal 8](../starter-configs/drupal8/index.md) site, but you can check out our
[starter configuration files](../starter-configs/index.md) to see if we've got a
code example to kick-start your setup.

```yaml
services:
  # What to call the service hosting the site.
  php:
    # Use PHP 7.x with Apache to serve a Drupal 8 site
    image: tugboatqa/php:7-apache

    # Set this as the default service. This does a few things
    #   1. Clones the git repository into the service container
    #   2. Exposes port 80 to the Tugboat HTTP proxy
    #   3. Routes requests to the preview URL to this service
    default: true

    # Wait until the mysql service is done building
    depends: mysql

    # A set of commands to run while building this service
    commands:
      # Commands that set up the basic preview infrastructure
      init:
        # Install opcache and enable mod-rewrite.
        - docker-php-ext-install opcache
        - a2enmod headers rewrite

        # Install drush-launcher
        - wget -O /usr/local/bin/drush

        # Link the document root to the expected path. This example links /web
        # to the docroot
        - ln -snf "${TUGBOAT_ROOT}/web" "${DOCROOT}"

      # Commands that import files, databases,  or other assets. When an
      # existing preview is refreshed, the build workflow starts here,
      # skipping the init step, because the results of that step will
      # already be present.
      update:
        # Use the tugboat-specific Drupal settings
        - cp "${TUGBOAT_ROOT}/.tugboat/settings.local.php"
          "${DOCROOT}/sites/default/"

        # Generate a unique hash_salt to secure the site
        - echo "\$settings['hash_salt'] = '$(openssl rand -hex 32)';" >>
          "${DOCROOT}/sites/default/settings.local.php"

        # Install/update packages managed by composer, including drush
        - composer install --no-ansi

        # Copy the files directory from an external server. The public
        # SSH key found in the Tugboat Repository configuration must be

        - rsync -av --delete user@example.com:/path/to/files/
          "${DOCROOT}/sites/default/files/"
        - chgrp -R www-data "${DOCROOT}/sites/default/files"
        - find "${DOCROOT}/sites/default/files" -type d -exec chmod 2775 {} \;
        - find "${DOCROOT}/sites/default/files" -type f -exec chmod 0664 {} \;

        # Alternatively, another common practice is to use the
        # stage_file_proxy Drupal module. This module lets Drupal serve
        # files from another publicly-accessible Drupal site instead of
        # syncing the entire files directory into the Tugboat Preview.
        # This results in smaller previews and reduces the build time.
        - drush -r "${DOCROOT}" pm-download stage_file_proxy
        - drush -r "${DOCROOT}" pm-enable --yes stage_file_proxy
        - drush -r "${DOCROOT}" variable-set stage_file_proxy_origin
