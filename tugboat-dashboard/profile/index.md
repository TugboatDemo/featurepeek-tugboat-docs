## Connected Accounts

When you initially signed in with your provider credentials, it created a
Tugboat user profile and gave Tugboat access to the repositories available to
this account. Additional provider accounts can be linked to your Tugboat
Profile, giving Tugboat access to the repositories available there. Multiple
accounts from the same provider can also be linked to your Tugboat Profile

Disconnecting a provider accounts prevents Tugboat from accessing any new
repositories for that provider account. Existing Tugboat Repositories are not
affected by this action, and need to be manually deleted.

## Name, Email & Announcements

When your Tugboat account is initially created it uses the name and email
address available from the provider account. You can change this later at any
time. When you change your email address you will receive an email with a
verification link.

You can also choose whether you want to recieve various notifications from
Tugboat.
