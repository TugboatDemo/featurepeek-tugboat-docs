# Create a Tugboat Account

Creating a Tugboat account is easily done by authenticating with your Git
provider account. Authenticating this way allows Tugboat to build previews for
any repository your account has access to.

## Authenticate Additional Git Providers (optional)

Authentication of additional Git provider accounts allows Tugboat to access additional git repositories that these accounts have access to. It also allows you to authenticate with any one of these providers to access your Tugboat account. This step is entirely optional, but to do so navigate to your user profile when logged in.

In your user profile, the *Connected Accounts* section lists the Git providers your Tugboat account has authenticated with. You can connect or disconnect your Git accounts from this page. When adding Repositories to your project, you will have access to choose from any repository you have access to from these accounts. You can connect to as many Github, Bitbucket, or Gitlab accounts that you want.
