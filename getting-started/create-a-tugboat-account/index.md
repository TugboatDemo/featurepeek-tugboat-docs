# Create a Tugboat Account

Creating a Tugboat account is done simply by authenticating with your Git
provider account. Authenticating this way allows Tugboat to build previews for
any repository your account has access to.

## Authenticate Additional Git Providers (optional)

Authentication additional Git provider accounts allows Tugboat to access
additional git repositories that these accounts have access to. It also allows
you to authenticate with any one of these providers to access your Tugboat
account. This step is completely optional, but to do so navigate to your user
profile when logged in.

In your user profile, the *Connected Accounts* section lists the Git providers
your Tugboat account is connected to. Here you can connect or disconnect Git
providers. When adding Repositories to your project you will have access to
choose from any repository you have access to in these accounts. You connect to
as many Github, Bitbucket, or Gitlab accounts that you want.
