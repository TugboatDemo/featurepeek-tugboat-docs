# Setting up a Repository

Tugboat assumes you already have a repository set up and under Git version
control with one of your Git Providers. Tugboat integrates with
[GitHub](https://github.com), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) or
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/product). If your project does not have a
repository, you will need to create a repository before using Tugboat.

Once you have created a repository, log into Tugboat by authenticating with the
Git Provider where your repository exists. Then, you will be able to create a
new project in Tugboat and add the repository or add the repository to an
existing Tugboat project.
