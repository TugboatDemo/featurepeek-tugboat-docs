# Create a Project

When authenticating to Tugboat for the first time you will be presented with a form to create your first Tugboat Project. In essence, a Tugboat Project will contain any amount of repositories you want Tugboat to build previews for, and is tied to a subscription model (free or premium). Additionally, you can invite users to join the project. You can create as many additional projects as you like later on.

As for the Project creation form, we start out by giving it a name. You can always update this later.

Then you have the opportunity to add a Repository to your project. You will be able to choose from any repository you have access to from any authenticated provider. You can always skip this step and add one or more repositories later from the Project dashboard.

When you add a Repository you'll need to what services it needs in order to operate. Presented here are a few bundled services for common solutions. These are quick starting templates to get you started. Later on you can edit or add new Services to your project. For more info about Services and how they work, check out the [Services chapter]() in the documentation.

Lastly, select a subscription tier for your project. Tiers range from a free plan to Starter, Pro, and Premium. Additionally enterprise plans are available as well. Alongside larger availble disk space, CPU and memory, one of the benefits of a premium tier are Base Previews. Base Previews speed up build times and lower build sizes significantly. To learn more, check out the [Base Previews section]() in the documentation.

After completing this form, you will be redirected to either the [Repository dashboard]() page or the [Project dashboard]() page depending whether you selected a repository. You can always add one or more Repositories later from the Project Dashboard:
