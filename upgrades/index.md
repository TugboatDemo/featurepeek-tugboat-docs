# Upgrading Software

This section will walk you through how to upgrade the software on your Tugboat base instance.

It’s important to remember that Tugboat operates in various Docker containers.  In your Tugboat UI, you’ll find separate terminal windows for each one.  To start, hop into your Tugboat UI, open the project settings, then access the Base Preview build settings.  You should see a section with terminals available for each container.  Open the terminal for the apache container.  This is where we’ll do most of our work.
