# Share a Preview

After you've built your Preview, there are a few ways you can share it:

- [Manually share the URL of your Preview](#manually-share-the-url-of-your-preview)
- [Configure Tugboat to automatically post Preview links in pull requests](#configure-tugboat-to-auto-post-preview-links)

### Manually share the URL of your Preview

Want to share a Preview link manually with Lisa in Product, or Al the client? Go
to the Preview you want to share, and either open the Preview and copy the URL
from the browser's address bar, or use the browser options to Copy Link on the
**Preview** button.

Send that link to the person who needs to look at the Preview, and they'll be
able to view it. Tugboat links are hard-to-guess secure URLs that are accessible
to anyone with the link; that person doesn't need to be a member of your
[Tugboat crew](../../administering-tugboat-crew/index.md), or able to view the
git repo where the code is hosted.

### Configure Tugboat to auto-post Preview links

When you're using the Tugboat integration with
[GitHub](../../setting-up-tugboat/index.md#github),
[GitLab](../../setting-up-tugboat/index.md#gitlab) or
[BitBucket](../../setting-up-tugboat/index.md#bitbucket), you can configure
Tugboat to automatically post links to Previews as comments on pull requests.
Configure this option in
[Repository Settings](../../setting-up-tugboat/index.md#modify-settings-for-your-github-gitlab-or-bitbucket-integration).
