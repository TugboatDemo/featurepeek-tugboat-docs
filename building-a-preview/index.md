## Build a Preview

Once you've [set up your Tugboat project](../setting-up-tugboat/create-a-project/index.md), [linked a repo](../setting-up-tugboat/add-repos-to-the-project/index.md), and [put your Config file in the linked repo](../setting-up-tugboat/create-a-config-file/index.md), it's time to build a Preview!

To build a Preview:

Click your username in the upper right-hand corner, and go to Projects;
2) Click the **My Projects** link;
3) Select the project where you want to build a Preview;
4) Click the name of the repo that contains the code you want to use to build the Preview;
5) Scroll down to the **Available to Build** section; by default, you'll see _Branches_, but you can switch to view Tags or Pull Requests that are available to Preview;
6) Press the **Build Preview** button to begin the build.

While the Preview is building, you'll see the Preview appear in the **Latest Previews** section, with a yellow status indicator _building_.

When the Preview is ready, the Preview button will turn blue, and you'll see a green status indicator _ready_. Simply press the Preview button to view the Preview. While you're at it, go ahead and [share your Preview](#share-your-preview) - we know you're proud of your work!
