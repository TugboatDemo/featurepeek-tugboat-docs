# Tugboat Services

A Tugboat Service plays the role of what a server might provide in a production
environment. A service can be a web server, a database server, a cache store,
etc. A set of services work together to create a [preview](../previews/index.md)
for a [repository](../repositories/index.md).

The services used to create a [preview](../previews/index.md) are defined by the
[configuration file](../../configuring-tugboat) for the
[repository](../repositories/index.md).
