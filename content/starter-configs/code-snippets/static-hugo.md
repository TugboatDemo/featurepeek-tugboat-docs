A Tugboat Preview for a [Hugo static site](https://gohugo.io/) builds the static site, and then serves it. This config
generates a static site that looks like your `hugo` build on your local development environment, but is accessible via
the secure Tugboat URL by anyone who has the link; no need for the viewer to have a local environment.

## Configure Tugboat

The Tugboat configuration is managed by a [YAML file](/setting-up-tugboat/create-a-tugboat-config-file/) at
`.tugboat/config.yml` in the git repository. Here's a basic Hugo static site configuration you can use as a starting
point, with comments to explain what's going on:

```yaml
services:
  # What to call the service hosting the site. Because there is only
  # one service, it is automatically set as the default service, which
  # does a few things
  #   1. Clones the git repository into the service container
  #   2. Exposes port 80 to the Tugboat HTTP proxy
  #   3. Routes requests to the preview URL to this service
  apache:
    # Use the available version of Apache by not specifying a version
    image: tugboatqa/httpd

    # A set of commands to run while building this service
    commands:
      # Commands that set up the basic preview infrastructure
      init:
        # Use curl to download Hugo into the Apache service
        - curl -Ls https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.58.3/hugo_0.58.3_Linux-64bit.tar.gz | tar -C
          /usr/local/bin -zxf
        # Install Hugo
        - hugo
        # I don't know what these two things do, and if they're needed for this Hugo starter config. Ben?
        - sed -i '/mod_rewrite/s/#//g' /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf
        - sed -i 's/AllowOverride None/AllowOverride All/g' /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf
      build:
        # Hugo's command to build your static site
        - hugo
        # Link the document root to the expected path. This example links the
        # /public directory generated by the Hugo build to the docroot
        - ln -snf "${TUGBOAT_ROOT}/public" "${DOCROOT}"
```
